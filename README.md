# 🚀Mobile Technical Challenge 💻

## Goal

Our goal with this task is to see how you work and your full potential with something that will be part of your day-to-day role at Base. While tasks will change on the fly to meet business needs, we want to see how you think about structure, execution, and performance metrics.

Additionally, this is a great opportunity for you to also interview us. Interact with part of the team (Jose/Lola) as much as you need and see how you enjoy our conversations.

## Important Note

We believe that great engineers take end-to-end responsibility for making something work, while some of our technologies will evolve, and even if you don’t have experience in some of the languages involved in this task we hope that you find a way to get the task done. If you experience major blockers, let Jose know!
